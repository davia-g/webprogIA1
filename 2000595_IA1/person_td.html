								I think the Keirsey Temperament Sorter is a pretty reliable test. 
								It is a free personality assessment tool that groups you into a temperament type. 
								It provided a pretty comprehensive overview of my perceived personality type. 
								The questions were of varying subjects and during the assessment you can start to notice patterns in your answers. 
								One drawback I have however is that there are only four (4) main temperament categories so that can lead to generalizations and stereotypes. 
								So everything might not be completely accurate, which was reflected in my case. Despite that, 
								I still think the Keirsey Temperament Sorter is a great tool for assessing and understanding your personality type.

								I received the ‘Guardian’ temperament. I think the keywords fairly describe my personality, as I view myself as a detailed, organized and dependable person. 
								I have been described by many as humble and hardworking, so I believe the Guardian core characteristics suite me well. 
								However, I somewhat disagree with a few of the core characteristics such as my type tend to make stabilized leaders, and focused on credentials and traditions. 
								I don’t really like the spotlight that much so I don’t see myself as a ‘stabilized leader’, 
								and while I do value credentials and traditions, I don’t think too much emphasis should be placed on them 
								because it can sometimes take people too far from reality and hinder progression or positive changes.

								I also agree with the statement on ‘having fun with friends’ and being a practical and down to earth person. 
								I really do enjoy spending time with my friends, but I also know when to prioritize and get work done.  
								Overall I believe the Keirsey Temperament Sorter is a solid tool to use if you want to understand your personality better.
